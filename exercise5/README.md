I tried to modify the frontend image size in the kurkkumopo exercise.
In Dockerfile1, I've tried the alpine version.
In Dockerfile2, I've tried what was told here: https://www.aptible.com/documentation/enclave/tutorials/faq/dockerfile-caching/npm-dockerfile-caching.html
Copying package.json before npm install and rest after.

In the backend part of kurkkumopo I've tried this https://www.aptible.com/documentation/enclave/tutorials/faq/dockerfile-caching/pip-dockerfile-caching.html

Obviously I've failed in optimising the image sizes.
